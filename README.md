# Sentiment Analysis and Automated Tweet Response Generation

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a cutting-edge system for performing real-time sentiment analysis and generating automated tweet responses. The goal is to enhance social media engagement by providing personalized and context-aware interactions.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project is to:
- Provide timely and contextually appropriate responses to enhance customer satisfaction.
- Efficiently manage large volumes of social media interactions.
- Generate relevant and meaningful replies by understanding the context and sentiment of tweets.

## Problem Statement

Create a system capable of performing real-time sentiment analysis and generating automated responses to tweets. This system should improve social media engagement by offering personalized, context-aware interactions.

## Components

### Sentiment Analysis Module (BERT)
- **Function**: Analyzes the sentiment of input text (positive, negative, or neutral).
- **Process**:
  - Tokenizes and encodes input text using BERT's tokenizer.
  - Passes encoded input through the BERT model for sentiment prediction.
  - Outputs a sentiment label for user feedback.

### Tweet Generation Module (GPT-2)
- **Function**: Generates tweets based on input topics.
- **Process**:
  - Uses GPT-2's tokenizer to encode the input topic.
  - Feeds the encoded topic into the GPT-2 model for text generation.
  - Produces a tweet based on the input topic.

### Response Generation Module (BART)
- **Function**: Generates contextually relevant responses to user tweets.
- **Process**:
  - Tokenizes and encodes the user's tweet using BART's tokenizer.
  - Inputs the encoded tweet into the BART model for response generation.
  - Outputs a contextually relevant response to the user's tweet.
